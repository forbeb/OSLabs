2.) No explicit license means "all rights reserved". If we do not choose a license our project is not open source as others are restricted in their use of the product under copyright law

3.) If there is no explict license then the poject is under copyright law

4.) I agree. If a product is unable to keep up with demands of consumers it will fail. This is basic economics and you'd have a hard time arguing against it. 

5.) Android uses the Apache license so the contributors may practice patent claims. They use this to encourage contributors to contribute

7.) Apache is best for developers because they may sublicense. Companies on the other hand would prefer GPL or LGPL because all modifications must be noted and the original must be included. Apache is better for the common good because its is better for developers. What is better for developers is better for the common good  because more developers will make changes and improve the software for everyone

9.) I'd like to make a project that assists automatically uses Investopedia to make "money" in their games. The users would be anyone that wanted to win a game on investopedia. Potentially it could be used to learn about stocks and how to make better investment decisions. I'd use the MIT license because its easy and simple.
