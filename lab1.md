Take a break - sometimes time allows you to think more clearly and you might be able to answer your problem without asking anyone

Do plenty of testing before asking. If you can more easily pinpoint the problem, it will be easier for someone to help you

C3. I was reassured that copyright law in this country promotes corruption at the top. Simply tinkering with something could lead to a whole of of trouble for people working with computers. By making an edit to a search engine to a public directory, Jesse inadvertently gave people a platform to pirate music. The music industry then bullied Jesse. This could easily happen to anyone here who tinkers with "the wrong things." Therefore we must be careful with what we work on and be prepared to face corrupt organizations.
